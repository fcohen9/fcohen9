        <p class="mva__text"> Redesign of Maryland Vehical Association forms, with the target user being persons over
            the age of 65 </p>

        <p class="mva__text--inspo"> Since my application was supposed to cater to those over the age of 65, I began by
            creating a user persona.
        </p>

        <img class="mva__inspo--user" src="/images/mva/user.png">

        <p class="mva__text--inspo"> I had some trouble beginning to generate visuals for this project, so I started by
            making a mindmap.
        </p>

        <img class="mva__inspo" src="/images/mva/process/mindmap.jpg">

        <p class="mva__text--inspo"> Once I did that and understood the content I was dealing with better, I drew up
            some quick wireframes.

        <img class="mva__inspo" src="/images/mva/process/wireframes/2.png">

        <p class="mva__text--inspo"> After completing some wireframes, I began to lay elements out.

        </div>
        <p class="mva__text--inspo"> Initially, I settled on this wordmark and color scheme. However, upon further
            reflection, I realized that my design was ignoring my user's needs, as it was very hard to read because of
            the
            small type (and the fact that I was using a display typeface for copy) and low contrast with the text vs
            the background. To solve this, I introduced new colors, changed my typefaces, and altered my grid.

    <div class="mva__deliverables--wrapper">

        <div class="screens">
            <p class="mva__text--deliverables"> I chose to use a bright blue and a bright orange for both the contrast
                that these colors provide, but also to make this application a little more fun, since the MVA is known
                for being dull and depressing. I chose to use the typeface Brown, as it is round and friendly.
            </p>
            <p class="mva__text--deliverables"> I altered my wordmark so that it would be more adaptable and able to be
                used both on a loading screen at a larger scale and within the header.
            </p>
            <img class="mva__screens" src="/images/mva/screens/loading.png">

            <p class="mva__text--deliverables"> Based on my user persona, I decided it was important for there to be a
                lot of check points within the app so that the user would be aware of where they are within the
                application.
            </p>
            <img class="mva__screens" src="/images/mva/screens/isthis.png">

            <p class="mva__text--deliverables"> I continued to think about how to best lead elderly users through the
                application, and decided to have a review screen after every section before the submit button appears,
                so that users can double check their information and make any changes that need to be made. The review
                screens appear after every section so that the user doesn't get confused or overwhelmed at the end when
                they are trying to submit their final forms.

                forms (in addition to reminding them where they are in the process). I chose to create some
                illustrations that appear when a user has completed forms.
