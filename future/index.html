                    <li>Almost everyone has a smart home</li>
                <li>We find out that aliens exist</li>
            <li>Phones are holographic</li>
        <li>You can send a person your thoughts like an email and they will see exactly what’s in your head (mind reading, but only when you want to send your thought) via an implant.</li></ul>

                    <p class="process">
                    I chose to work with the last imagined future: an implant that allows the user to send thoughts like emails. </p>
                    <p class="process">I developed some quick possible user personas to help me think about how people in the future would feel about this implant.</p>

                            <p class="process">I chose to do a more in depth case study of Lilly and to see what she might feel is missing or wrong with the implant. In order to better gauge her pain points, I draw out an empathy map. </p>
                            <img src=/images/future/map.png>
                           <p class="process"> From this, I made a list.</p>
                           <ul>
                               <li>She wants her privacy and she feels like this implant is invasive</li>
                               <li>Even when she sends her thoughts, her parents still dismiss her sometimes and it makes her feel bad</li>
                               <li>She likes to use it with her friends but she has a big mouth so with the tech, she spills even more secrets</li>
                               <li>Her little brother sends her thoughts CONSTANTLY and so he bugs her even when she’s not with him</li>
                               <li>She accidentally shared a daydream of kissing her crush with her crush! It was so embarrassing!</li>
                               <li>companies can advertise to you via sending thoughts (like bus stop ads, but instead when you pass a certain place a thought gets sent to you) and she finds it very annoying</li>
                               <li>she feels she has less control and autonomy and sometimes wishes she didn’t have the implant</li>

                           </ul>

                           <p class="process">Then I brainstormed possible solutions to help Lilly with her pain points.</p>
                           <ul><li>it’s kind of like an ad blocker but for your brain so you can decide who can send you thoughts (and so you can avoid ads all the time)
                            </li>
                        <li>it’s kind of like the app self control that lets you blacklist websites but for people (like her brother)</li>
                    <li>you can turn off your implant if you want to be alone</li>
                <li>It’s like how texts and emails are saved so you can go back to them and see what you sent</li>
                <li>it’s like a combo of taking a photo and saving an email draft so you can save a thought to have it for memories or to send to someone later</li>
            </ul>
<p class="process"> To understand this user even further, I drew some storyboards of scenerios that might happen in Lilly's life</p>
<img src="/images/future/lilly1.png">
<img src="/images/future/lilly2.png">

<p class="process"> Through this research, I decided that Lilly needed some kind of application that allows the user to save thoughts, save drafts of thoughts to send later, and block certain people or corporations from sending thoughts.
    </p>
<p class="process">I created some quick UI sketches, and quickly realized that an application with all three of those features would be muddy and difficult to use, since saving thoughts and blocking things are very different actions.</p>
<img src="/images/future/ui.png">
<p class="deliverables">I decided it would help Lilly more to block people and ads, so I invisioned an application called BrainBlock.</p>

                            <p class="deliverables__titles">Context Statement</p>
                            <p class="deliverables">It's the year 2059, and an implant invented 8 years ago allows people to share thoughts like texts or emails. For example, instead of explaining a complex idea, a user can could simply send it to another user. This implant hasn’t fully made other forms of communication obsolete. For example, this doesn’t mean that people don’t speak anymore, like how in the year 2020, people have the option to send an email, which is easier, but some still opt to send snail mail.
                                    Almost everybody has the implant and babies get it right when they’re born. It’s as normal as cellphones were in 2020. Corporations have switched from traditional ads to site specific ad spots, where, when a user passes a certain location, they will be sent an ad, straight to their brain. The implant is pretty new technology, so it’s not perfect and doesn’t have that many features. However, since it’s been on the market for 8 years now, people have started to develop plugins, extensions, and applications to make up for the features the im- plant is missing. That’s where BrainBlock comes in. Do you want to avoid those annoying geo-ads?
                                    Or turn off your little brother’s constant thought sends? Or maybe your husband just won’t stop nagging you, and you need a little peace. Do you sometimes wish you could turn off your implant entirely?</p>

                                    <p class="deliverables__titles">Problems Solved</p>

                                    <p class="deliverables"> In order see how BrainBlock solves some of these problems, we’ll look at one use case, a 16 year old girl named Lilly who lives with her parents and her annoying little brother. Her brother is constantly sending her thoughts, and since he’s already a contact, she can’t do anything about it. BrainBlock solves this problem with its ContactBlock feature, since she can now customize who can
                                            send her thoughts, even if they’re already contacts. Lilly loves to listen to music on the way home, but the constant Geo-Ads ruin her peaceful walk. With the Geo-Ad Block feature, Lilly can turn off geo-ads in a variety of ways, and walk home in peace. Lilly is a teen, and already feels like everybody’s on her case. The implant makes her feel even more constricted. 00MODE, or “RetroMode,” solves this problem. This feature is simple; it allows Lilly to effectively turn off her implant by blocking every thought that is sent to her.
                                            Although we’ve only looked at one use case, this product is for almost everyone, as its features have the possibility to help many users live quieter, more independent lives.</p>

                                            <p class="deliverables">Jeff Brown said
                                                </p>
                                            <p class="quote">“ Sometimes I worry about my privacy with this implant in my head, so I was excited when I heard about BrainBlock. I tried it out, and my sense of security soared.</p>
                                            <p class="deliverables">Sally Smith said</p>
                                            <p class="quote">"I sometimes wish I could the implant off, like when I'm sleeping, so my baby doesn't send me thoughts and accidentally wake me. BrainBlock has provided an easy and affordable solution.”</p>

                                            <p class="deliverables__titles">Next Steps</p>
                                            <p class="deliverables">With its affordable price, array of features, and an easy to use interface, BrainBlock is the best extension of its kind on the market. It is downloadable by thinking “Application Store” followed by “BrainBlock.” The app is available for just .617 arcs, or 1mg of local data.</p>

                                            <p class="deliverables">Because this is an app in the future, I couldn't continue on with the assumption that phones would exist in the form that they do now. To solve this problem, I invisioned something like a smartphone, but it is a holograph projected in front of the user, via the implant, and instead of tapping to select, a user thinks to select. Because there is no screen, there is no minimum height, so this allowed me to play with the visual design a little more. </p>

                                            <p class="deliverables">I wanted to add in a little bit of a dystopian vibe, so the last sentence of the agreement signs away all of the user's data. The application refers to the user only as a number. The app can also be purchased with data instead of money, as a nod to how we can use applications for free, but they collect our data. </p>

                                            <p class="deliverables">In terms of the visual design, I chose a monospace typeface, like what was used on the first computers, to indicate that this technology is new. I also wanted it to seem a little cold, so I used generic blue and red.    </p>
