                    <p class="process"> I attended Bitcamp this year as a design mentor, helping engineers make their applications usable and doing a little bit of UI work. Going into the weekend, I was unsure what I would be doing, but the UX heavy work was super fun. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="process">
                    It was my first time working directly with engineers, and it was such an interesting experience. Engineers think so differently about products than designers and have such different priorities. The teams I talked with had not thought at all about the usablity of their applications</p>

                            <p class="deliverables">From doing this work, I did not end up with traditional deliverables, but instead some in depth analysis of applications and how I helped the teams fix their projects. </p>

                                    <h2>Helped Khawaja Shahrukh's Team</h2>
                                    <p class="deliverables">They were creating an application to help with grocery shopping and food organization </p>
                                    <p class="deliverables">They mainly had usability issues. For example:<ul>
                                        <li>They had a lot of extra features that detracted from the user experience. </li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>For example, they had notes section with “all notes” and “shopping.” Shopping was for grocery lists and "all notes" was for anything else.</li>
                                            <li>It was an app for shopping and had nothing to do with writing random notes,
                                                 so it was confusing why there was an all notes section. 
                                                 I advised them to delete it, but they really wanted to keep it, so I told them to just make it a separate section.</li></ul>
                                            
                                            <li>I advised them to increase margins and change the 3 column grid they were using on an iOS app to 2 column one</li>
                                            
                                            <li>They had an exclamation point icon to indicate when a user was running out of a food/ it was going bad, but for example, the interface would 
                                                read <ul><li> ! Apples 4 </li>
                                           <li> Oranges 2 </li></ul>
                                    <li>So it was unclear which of the 4 apples was bad or if they were all bad. I told them they needed another page where a user could click a food with the ! icon
                                        and get more information. 
                                    </li> </ul>
                                            </p></div>

                        <p class="deliverables">They were making an application for person to person payments, like Venmo</p>
                        <p class="deliverables">They also mostly had usability issues. They were only making part of an app, so initially they had no user pathways. I helped them think through their user pathways and create a more robust wireframe to work off of. I helped them organize their information in a more user friendly way. </p>

                        <p class="deliverables"> I advised them to add additional pages instead of having an infinite scroll, simplify their navigation, and put more emphasis on the actual intended use, which was helping organize payments between groups of people, by making the first screen purely imputs, and then the data visualization pages.

                <p class="deliverables"> They were working on a superhero themed, education/confidence building application, called "I Am Great." I do not know very much about superheros but we spoke and decided on bright colors and a cheerful aesthetic. I made them two final logos, one typemark and one that was more illustrative. </p>
                <p class="deliverables">This team actually ended up winning the award for "Best Application for Encouraging Higher Education." </p>

            <p class="deliverables bold__bitcamp"> Doing mostly straight UX work for other people and not very much visual design was slightly out of my comfort zone, but I learned so much about communication with non-designers and greatly improved my ablity to do UX work quickly.  </p>
