    <div class="process">
            
            <p class="process"> I've designed long publications before, but never a publication with screen, print, and branding components. This project was at a much larger scale than I had worked at before. Because of this, I started this project by thinking about who I wanted to make this magazine for. I decided my target audience was teens through young adults</p>

            <p class="process">I created two potential users, Laurie and John. </p>

            <p class="process">
                "My name is Laurie and I am 14 years old. I feel like everybody else is cooler than me, like they have cooler clothes and do their makeup nicely. I don’t understand where they learned how to be cool. I wish there was a website that would tell me what was cool so that I can be cooler in school. My mom says I’m just going through my “rebellious phase,” but I feel like it’s not a phase. I really like the show Skins because I wish my life was fun and cool and exciting like that. I’d read or watch something else that shows me the life I wish I had, like going to crazy parties and kissing boys. Not to mention my mom would freak if I was reading something about doing drugs or boys and stuff." </p>

            <p class="process">"I’m John, I’m 26, and I’m a bartender. I unfortunately did not finish college, but I’m not a dumb guy. I want to be a musician and I’m already pretty with the times; I always dress nice, I thrift practically everything. I don’t love reading but I want to learn about what’s going on in the world so I can be well informed and, additionally, not seem dumb when other people start conversations about current events.  I like serious articles, but not only serious articles. All those magazines that my friends read like the New Yorker get so boring. To be honest, I think everyone is pretending to like the New Yorker. I wish there was a source with both informative articles that I can talk about at parties and also some more fun parts to get me to finish those longer articles. I’d also like something that gives me information that other people wouldn’t know so I am more interesting, but not something super long or hard to read." 
            </p>

            <p class="process">Based on my user personas, I made a list of possible content/sections.
                <ul><li>Playlist</li>
                <li>Photo Essay</li>
            <li>Movie or Book Review</li>
        <li>Profile</li>
    <li>Infographs or Statistics</li>
<li>Fashion</li>
<li>Recommendations</li>
<li>Features</li>
<li>News/Culture</li></ul>
            </p> </div> 
        <p class="large"> This was such a large project that I broke it down into three sections. </p>
        
            
        
                    <h5>Web</h5>
                        
                        
    <p class="process">I started by quickly sketching some layouts </p>
    <img class="wireframe" src="/images/scheme/sketch.jpg">

    <p class="process"> A large part of my process is getting feedback and then iterating, so I went through quite a few versions of the website. </p>

            <h5>Print</h5>
            <h4 class="divider"> <span> process </span> </h4>
    <p class="process">The scale of the print piece was smaller and only included a cover, table of contents, feature article, profile, and photo essay.</p>

    <p class="process">Here are some initial sketched print designs</p>

            <h5>Branding</h5>
            <p class="process">This magazine is for teens and young adults, so the tone is rebellious and a little sneaky (or scheme-y...) </p>
    <p class="process">I wanted the magazine to be on the edgier side, so I chose to use black, white, and neon green as my main color palette. </p>
    <div class="black"></div>
    <div class="green"></div>
<p class="process">On this same vein, I settled on a handwritten, punchy typemark. </p>

<img class="typemark" src="/images/scheme/typemark.svg">



    <p class="process"> As a personal challenge for myself, I wanted to use as many typefaces as I could while still maintaining cohesion across the site. Speculating that it were a real magazine, different articles would have different, specific header typefaces. </p>

<img class="type" src="/images/scheme/web-type.png">

<p class="process"> As the print portion of this project is smaller than the web version, I did not use all of these typefaces. If I had more time, I would make the whole magazine, both web AND print </p>
