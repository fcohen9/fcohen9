        <p class="process">The problem I wanted to solve with this product was the lack of health apps that are actually healthy. The majority of current diet apps encourage unhealthy eating habits and lifestyles, like counting calories, cutting out food groups, and equating health with weight loss.</p>

        <p class="process"> I started this project figuring out my problem statement</p>
            

<p class="process">Our user struggles to get healthier because they do not know how. Current health apps donâ€™t actually encourage healthy behavior, shaming our user and putting too much emphasis on weight loss. Our solution should deliver an easy to use, not calorie or weight-loss centric, and positive application to help our user learn to be healthier.  </p>


        <p class="process">I started with some competitive analysis to confirm my assumptions about current health apps and their users. </p>
        <p class="subtitle">Lose It!</p>

        <p class="list"><ul><li>It's easy to record food, water, and exercise</li><li>Shows user trends</li><li>Not as ugly as other weight loss apps</li><li>Allows users to input exercise data</li></ul></p>
       
        <p class="subsubtitle bold">Cons</p>

            <li>It lets you set weight loss goals</li><li>Gives you "daily budget" of calories</li><li>Has under 400/500 calorie meal plans</li><li>Suggests number of calories per meal</li><li>Only uses exercise data for calorie counting</li></ul></p></div></div>

        <div class="list">
        <p class="subsubtitle bold">Pros</p>
        <p class="list"><ul><li>Initial options include maintain weight and gain weight; Does not assume user goal is to lose weight</li><li>Asks you questions like "How active are you?" (More emphasis on actual health, not weight loss)</li><li>Easy to set up and get plan</li><li>Doesn't let set calorie intake go below 1200</li><li>Has recipes that are healthy, but not ridiculously low calorie</li></ul></p>
        <p class="subsubtitle bold">Cons</p>

        <p class="process">Through this, my assumption that health apps are very weight-loss centric was confirmed. My assumption that people of all genders, races, and ages use health apps was also confirmed. </p>
   
     


<p class="process"> I made a couple of quick user personas in order to narrow down main user goals: </p>

<img class="users" src="/images/health/users/u1.png">
<img class="users" src="/images/health/users/u2.png">
<img class="users" src="/images/health/users/u3.png">
<img class="users" src="/images/health/users/u4.png">

<p class="process">From these user personas, I started brainstorming. For example: </p>
<ul><li>Quick to learn and use</li><li>Take the numbers out of it; simplify</li><li>Set custom goals</li>
    <li>Some kind of log, worksheet, or other major interactive element </li><li>Mental health included</li><li>Illustrations aren't really a feature, but I wanted this app to be as positive as possible and thought that fun illustrations would help. </li></ul>

    <p class="process">I decided to make a web app because I wanted the experience to be more like filling out a (fun) worksheet or playing a game. </p>

    <p class="process">I began with a simple userflow, and then thought about the visuals to complement my interactions.</p>

<img class="lofi" src="/images/health/lofi/flow.jpg">
<img class="lofi" src="/images/health/lofi/ui1.jpg">
<img class="lofi" src="/images/health/lofi/ui2.jpg">

<p class="process">After wireframing, I made a higher fidelity prototype based on my sketches and my list of features. </p>

<img class="medfi" src="/images/health/medfi/1.png">
<img class="medfi" src="/images/health/medfi/2.png">
<img class="medfi" src="/images/health/medfi/3.png">
<img class="medfi" src="/images/health/medfi/4.png">
<img class="medfi" src="/images/health/medfi/5.png">
<img class="medfi" src="/images/health/medfi/6.png">
<img class="medfi" src="/images/health/medfi/7.png">



<p class="process">In order to create a health app without any dieting or restricting, I decided to first create an info page with information about why different aspects of health are important in many different ways. I really wanted to emphasize that maintaining a healthy relationship with food and exercise is critical.</p>

<p class="process">To make this app more fun, I decided that it should be very interactive so that the user is consistently engaged. I created a landing page with a fun animation to introduce users to the feel of the app</p>

<p class="process">I did end up doing a couple of illustrations, and I used calming colors. </p>

<p class="process">I was lucky enough to be able to do user testing with this web app, and I got helpful feedback like that it was slightly confusing where the user was within the app. It was great to be able to do user testing because my users poked a lot of holes, but I was then able to go and fix them. For example, I changed my nav structure quite a bit from my medium fidelity prototype to my final one.  </p>

        <p class="process">Here is a video showing the majority of the interactions.</p>

        <iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r9SGYofcp60" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        

        <p class="process">I was super happy with the javascript I wrote for this site, especially the large date counter (it will always show the correct date). While my coding skills are definitely improving, I wasn't able to make everything look exactly how I wanted it to. However, in this instance, I think the micro interactions, like the hovers and animations, are more important than small visual imperfections. And overall, I got the majority of what I wanted done. </p>

        <p class="process">I'd like to add more features to this application, like a "view your history" page. One day, when I have time and have improved my coding skills even more, I want to fully finish this web app and make it completely usable. I want a user to be able to make an account, sign in, and log data.  </p></div>
