<p class="process">For this product, the problem I was trying to solve was a lack of ways for young kids to communicate digitally, since most of them don’t have phones or anything.
    My target audience was kids under 10 who are able to read and write, but are more comfortable and happier if they don’t have to. 
    
    </p>

        
        <p class="process"> After defining my problem statement, I begun a user persona. I was lucky enough to be able to interview an actual 9 year old. I asked him what kinds of things he would like in an app in order to talk to his friends. He told me he didn't like typing and that when he texts or messages through his parent’s phones, he just likes to send emojis. From my interview, I created a more fleshed out user persona in order to help guide me moving forward. </p>

        <img class="userpersona" src="/images/neighbors/process/userpersona.png">

            <p class="process">From my user persona, I brainstormed possible features, like canned responses because based on my user persona I knew that kids mostly didn’t like to type. I knew I wanted custom emojis as I wanted them to fit in my design system, and the standard emojis did not. 
                Those are the two features I ended up designing pages for, but I also thought about video chatting. I scrapped that though because this app is for young kids, so safety is really important and video chatting can get unsafe very quickly. </p>

                <p class="process bold"><h5>Initial Designs</h5> </p>
                <p class="process">Based on my interview and user persona, I knew that I needed a friendly and very easy to use
                    application, so I did some quick wireframes </p>
                  
                    <img class="wireframes" src="/images/neighbors/process/wireframe1.png">
               <p class="process">After this UX/research phase, I started thinking about my design system. 
                In terms of color palette, I didn’t want to use pastels because they’re too baby-ish
                for my ideal user, but I still wanted bright, engaging colors. </p>
                <p class="process">I used a card style layout because, since it’s for kids, there are not many moving parts to this application, and the only thing that switches is when you click either the smily pink icon or the question mark icon, the emojis or the canned phrases pop up. 

                    I also knew that my system needed to be as simple and clear as possible, and a card style layout allowed for that. </p>
                    <p class="process">Instead of profile pictures, each user can pick a color for their smiley face. This is a safety feature, while still allowing kids to have some fun and feel like they have more freedom within the app. 
                    </p>

                        tried out a
                        couple of higher resolution layout options and color combinations</p>

                <h5 class="process bold">Emoji</h5>
                <p class="process">Because my user so specifically mentioned liking emojis/stickers, I made some custom emojis that better fit with my design system.</p>

        <p class="process">These are emojis for children, so I wanted the colors to be friendly, fun, and bright,
            but still
            cohesive as a set. </p>
        <img class="colors" src="/images/neighbors/process/colors.png"></div>



       

        <p class="process">I knew from the start that I wanted my emojis to be cute, but in my own style. I
            initially had flat,
            geometric
            emojis without shadows. However, this made them look pretty generic and boring. </p>

        <img class="initialemojis2" src="/images/neighbors/process/old2.svg">


        <p class="process"> To make them more fun, I edited the shapes to make them less geometric. I added shadows
            to make
            them more dimensional. </p>

   <p class="process"> The scope of the project did not include multiple user pathways, but if/ when I revise this product, I will definitely be adding a separate parental login, where parents can turn on and off the ability for their child to actually type, and instead just let them use the canned responses and emojis. In the parental version, “pals” must be confirmed before the child can chat with them. The parental login page would be for settings and safety features. I would also make the landing page buttons do more clear, like what is the difference between sign up and try it (sign up is to actually use it, try it is to see an explanatory video).</p>
