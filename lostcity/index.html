        <p class="lostcity__text--inspo1"> we began this project by asking our "stakeholder" some general questions,
            like what they felt the biggest
            problems with the current site were, and what they liked and wanted to keep.
        </p>
        <img class="oldwebsite" src="/images/lostcity/process/oldwebsite.png">
        <ul class="eval">
            <li class="question">What do you like most about current site?</li>

            <li class="answer">Aesthetic, retro sci fi</li>

            <li class="question"> What are the main problems? </li>
            <li class="answer">when was it last updated? </li>
            <li class="answer">hierarchy is bad </li>
            <li class="answer">it’s not accessible (a bunch of images that don’t have alt descriptions) </li>
            <li class="answer">it is closed </li>
            <li class="answer">not responsive</li>

            <li class="question">What do you think our target audience wants? </li>

            <li class="answer">Menu and hours very easily</li>


            <li class="question"> What would a sucessful redesign look like?</li>

            <li class="answer"> More easy to navigate and more accessible</li>
        </ul>


        <p class="lostcity__text--inspo1"> Then, I made a priority guide based on this information:

            <p class="lostcity__text--inspo2"> Based on the feedback from my stakeholder and my priority guide, I then
                sketched out some wireframes:
            </p>

            <img class="wireframe" src="/images/lostcity/process/wireframes/wf1.jpg"> <img class="wireframe" src="/images/lostcity/process/wireframes/wf2.jpg">
            <img class="wireframe" src="/images/lostcity/process/wireframes/wf3.jpg"> <img class="wireframe1" src="/images/lostcity/process/wireframes/wf4.jpg">

            <p class="lostcity__text--inspo2"> From the wireframes, I started to do some more in depth layouts.
            </p>

            <img class="process__initial2" src="/images/lostcity/process/initial2.png">
            <img class="process__initial3" src="/images/lostcity/process/initial3.png">
        </div>
        <p class="lostcity__text--inspo1">Initially I was going to use the old logo since my stakeholder liked the vibe
            of it,
            but ended up changing
            it to update it as I was updating the website. Originally, I kept the color scheme of the original website,
            just updating
            the
            images,
            buttons, and changing
            the hierarchy of the information. As I continued with the project, I ended up scrapping the dark color
            scheme for a lighter, more pleasant one, while still maintaining the comic book vibe. </p>

        <img class="processlarge two" src="/images/lostcity/process/2.png">
        <img class="processlarge three" src="/images/lostcity/process/3.png">
        <p class="lostcity__text--inspo1"> I made some cute illustrations to go along with the comic book/ cozy vibe of
            the
            restaurant. They are decorative elements but also help the revamped website feel more cohesive, as that was
            a problem that my stakeholder mentioned. </p>

        <p class="lostcity__text--inspo1"> The final website was not the most important thing that I got from doing
            this project. I practiced making wireframes and doing research, but also practiced designing pixel perfect
            mockups with that knowledge in hand. I am improved my coding skills Immensely, to a point where I feel
            comfortable in semantic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also how to use pre-processors and static site
            generators, git and github, and about user personas and testing. Having this knowledge helps me so much as
            a product designer because I can design more practically and realistically -- and I learned that I really
            just love coding! </p>
